# Escape special characters to ASCII based on unicode.

This is an atom plugin to escape special characters.

Languages where we have a lot of special characters like portuguese, increases the numbers of Non-ASCII characters in the repository, which can be a problem when we work in different work stations, due character codification, so  this plugin helps keeping the repository without Non-ASCII characters, minimizing this problem.
